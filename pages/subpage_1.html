            <h1>Key Job Roles in Web Development</h1>
            <p>Web development offers excellent career prospects, 
                with opportunities ranging from working in tech startups 
                to large corporations, agencies, and freelancing. With the
                constant evolution of technologies and frameworks, continuous 
                learning and adaptability are key. Many developers advance to roles 
                like lead developer, project manager, or even CTO, while others may 
                specialize further in areas like security or performance optimization.

                As businesses across all industries rely more heavily on their online
                 presence, the demand for skilled web developers continues to grow, offering 
                 a promising and rewarding career path.</p>
